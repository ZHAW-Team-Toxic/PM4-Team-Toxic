All images will be packed  in to on texture per subfolder.


> [!CAUTION]
>
> When adding new texures you need to repack them with `./gradlew texturepacker`


## Troubleshooting

If the gradle texturepacker fails add `--stacktrace` to get more information. 

If the size is to small change the settings in `pack.json`
